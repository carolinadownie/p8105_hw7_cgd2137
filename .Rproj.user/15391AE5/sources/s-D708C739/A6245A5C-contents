##Problem 1
There are two cases to address:

For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the mean of non-missing values
For character variables, you should fill in missing values with "virginica"
Write a function that takes a vector as an argument; replaces missing values using the rules defined above; and returns the resulting vector. Apply this function to the columns of iris_with_missing using a map statement.

Sometimes you might want to use the mean of numeric variables; other times you might want to use the median. Edit your function so that different summaries can be used for numeric variables. Apply this function to the columns of iris_with_missing using a map statement, first using mean and then using median.


```{r loading iris dataset}

library(tidyverse)

set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

```{r build-up to function}
#If I was dealing with an individual vector
mean_Sepal.Length<-iris_with_missing$Sepal.Length %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(., 2)

#This takes an individual vector and returns an individual vector
iris_with_missing$Sepal.Length %>% replace(., is.na(iris_with_missing$Sepal.Length), mean_Sepal.Length)

```
